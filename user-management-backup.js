// BACKUP OF ORIGINAL USER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
// This file contains the original user management code that was causing issues
// Created as a backup before rewriting the system from scratch

// Original GLOBAL_USERS definition
const GLOBAL_USERS = {
    'superadmin@couchmancompanies.com': { 
        name: 'Super Admin', 
        role: 'super_admin', 
        password: 'super123',
        brands: 'all',
        locations: 'all'
    },
    // ... rest of users
};

// Original user management functions
function addUser(name, email, role, password, brands, locations) {
    // Complex logic with brands/locations handling
}

function handleAuth(email, password) {
    // Complex authentication with RBAC integration
}

function loadUsers() {
    // Complex user loading with fixes
}

// Note: The full implementation is preserved in the git history
// This backup serves as a reference for the complex logic that was removed
